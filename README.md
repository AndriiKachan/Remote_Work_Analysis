# Remote_Work_Analysis

# üåø Background
I was looking to better to understand how working remotely affects stress levels, work-life balance, and mental health conditions across various industries and regions. I felt the best way to start was to use a dataset from Kaggle.

[Check out this dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/waqi786/remote-work-and-mental-health)

# üìã Dataset

The dataset contains the following columns:

* **Employee_ID:** Unique identifier for each employee.
* **Age:** Age of the employee.
* **Gender:** Gender of the employee.
* **Job_Role:** Current role of the employee.
* **Industry:** Industry the employee works in.
* **Work_Location:** Whether the employee works remotely, hybrid, or onsite.
* **Stress_Level:** Self-reported level of stress (Low, Medium, High).
* **Mental_Health_Condition:** Any reported mental health condition (Anxiety, Depression, etc).
* **Social_Isolation_Rating:** A self-reported rating (1-5) of how isolated the employee feels.
* **Satisfaction_with_Remote_Work:** How satisfied the employee is with remote work arrangements (Satisfied, Neutral, Unsatisfied).

# üìå Goals

* **Data Cleaning:**(Removing missing duplicates, handing missing values and data inconsistencies)
* **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** (Analyze the data to uncover patterns and relationships between variables)
* **Data Modeling:** (Apply models to analyze relationships and predict outcomes based on the data)
* **Interpretation and Insight Generation:**(Generate actionable insights to improve work-life balance, mental health, and productivity)
* **Data Visualization and Reporting:** (Create visualizations and reports to clearly communicate analysis findings)

# üõ†Ô∏è Methods

* **Descriptive Analytics:** (Mean, Median, Standard Deviation, Histograms, Bar Charts, Pie Charts)
* **Diagnostic Analytics** (Pearson Correlation, Spearman Rank Correlation, T-tests)
* **Prescriptive Analytics** (Recommendations)

# ‚öôÔ∏è Technologies Used
